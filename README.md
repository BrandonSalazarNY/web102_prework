## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some challenges I faced during my time making this app was time dedication as I spanned my project over 2 days and had many things to balance while doing this project.
Another challenge I faced was the need to improve my coding skills in the aspects of javascript.
I faced a learning curve.
